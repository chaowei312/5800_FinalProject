        "  - For a data driven study, the Introduction is about the data science question and the topics you plan to explore. It helps the reader to understand what the data science question is, what the supporting topics and issues are, and what the overall research area is all about. An introduction allows the reader to “get to know” the data science question and related areas of interest. Ideally, an introduction should make the reader *care* about the topics and read more. The Introduction is NOT about the datasets, variables, methods or models. The Intro should not contain any information about the dataset or the data cleaning, prep, processing, etc. These things should go into the methods section. Introductions can and should include basis, background, history, the state-of-the-art, images, references, etc. An introduction will also help the reader to understand who the topics affect and why the topics matter.\n",

        "\n",
        "  - Introduce your topic\n",
        "    - The first job of the introduction is to tell the reader what your topic is and why it’s interesting or important. This is generally accomplished with a strong opening hook.The hook is a striking opening sentence that clearly conveys the relevance of your topic. Think of an interesting fact or statistic, a strong statement, a question, or a brief anecdote that will get the reader wondering about your topic.\n",
        "  - Describe the background\n",
        "    - Part of the introduction is a concise literature review to demonstrate that the writer is familiar with the relevant research. You can provide an overview of the most relevant research that has already been conducted. This is a sort of miniature literature review, a sketch of the current state of research into your topic, boiled down to a few paragraphs.\n",
        "    - This should be informed by genuine engagement with the literature. Your search can be less extensive than in a full literature review, but a clear sense of the relevant research is crucial to inform your own work.\n",
        "  - Establish your research problem\n",
        "    - In an empirical research paper, try to lead into the problem on the basis of your discussion of the literature. Think in terms of these questions:\n",
        "      - What research gap is your work intended to fill?\n",
        "      - What limitations in previous work does it address?\n",
        "      - What contribution to knowledge does it make?\n",
        "  - Specify your objective(s)\n",
        "    - The research question is the question you want to answer in an empirical research paper. Present your research question clearly and directly, with a minimum of discussion at this point. The rest of the paper will be taken up with discussing and investigating this question; here you just need to express it.\n",
        "  - Map out your paper\n",
        "    - The final part of the introduction is often dedicated to a brief overview of the rest of the paper.\n",
        "    - In a paper structured using the standard scientific “introduction, methods, results, discussion” format, this isn’t always necessary. But if your paper is structured in a less predictable way, it’s important to describe the shape of it for the reader. If included, the overview should be concise, direct, and written in the present tense.\n"
