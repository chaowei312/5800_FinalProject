This work investigates whether recurrent Transformers with shared weights can provide a more parameter-efficient alternative to standard encoder architectures for text classification.

Our results show that recurrent Transformers maintain competitive accuracy while substantially reducing parameter count, demonstrating favorable trade-offs between model capacity and efficiency. As a supplementary deployment-oriented analysis, we examine FP16 quantization and observe stable performance with further reductions in model size and inference latency. Together, these findings indicate that iterative recurrence can effectively substitute for depth stacking in encoder-based classification tasks, offering a practical path toward parameter-efficient Transformer deployment.\n"

        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformer architectures dominate modern natural language processing, but their strong performance typically comes at the cost of large parameter counts and substantial computational overhead. As model depth increases, memory footprint, training cost, and inference latency grow rapidly, limiting the practicality of standard Transformers in resource-constrained or efficiency-sensitive settings. This motivates the study of parameter-efficient architectural alternatives that can preserve predictive performance while significantly reducing model size.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this work, we investigate whether recurrent Transformers with shared weights can provide a more parameter-efficient substitute for standard Transformer encoders in text classification tasks. Rather than proposing a new architecture, our goal is to systematically analyze the trade-offs between standard and recurrent Transformers under controlled parameter budgets. We compare a conventional 6-layer Transformer baseline against recurrent variants that reuse a smaller set of layers through iterative refinement, isolating the effect of weight sharing on performance and efficiency. All models share identical modern components (Flash Attention, SwiGLU, RoPE, RMSNorm) to ensure that observed differences stem from architectural structure rather than implementation choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond aggregate accuracy, we evaluate robustness across multiple stress settings, including reduced training data regimes, short versus long input sequences, and cross-domain generalization. For completeness, we additionally examine the effect of FP16 quantization on model size and inference latency, treating it as a deployment-oriented optimization rather than a primary modeling contribution. These experiments allow us to assess not only whether recurrent Transformers are parameter-efficient, but under what conditions such efficiency remains reliable. Our findings show that recurrent Transformers can maintain competitive performance with substantially fewer parameters across a range of realistic constraints, supporting their use as a practical and efficient alternative to standard Transformer encoders for classification tasks.\n"

        "Recent advances in depth-recurrent transformer architectures offer a promising direction for model compression. The Universal Transformer [1] introduced the concept of applying the same transformation block iteratively, effectively trading parameters for computation. More recent work has extended this idea: the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) framework [2] combines parameter sharing with adaptive computation, dynamically allocating depth per token. Similarly, the Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) [5] demonstrates that a compact ~7M parameter network with recursive reasoning can outperform much larger models on complexed tasks like ARC-AGI benchmarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "These developments are particularly relevant in the context of reasoning-intensive tasks, where deeper processing has been shown to improve performance. By reusing layers across multiple iterations, recurrent transformers can achieve an effective depth that exceeds their physical layer count, enabling smaller models to develop richer representations without the parameter overhead of traditional deep networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern transformer implementations also benefit from architectural innovations such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) [3], which encodes relative positional information directly into attention computations, and SwiGLU activation functions [4], which provide improved gradient flow through gated linear units. These components have become standard in efficient transformer designs."

        "\n",
        "This study compares standard depth-stacked Transformers with recurrent Transformers that share weights under a controlled classification setting. On short-text benchmarks such as SST-2, the standard Transformer achieves slightly higher accuracy, but at more than twice the parameter and memory cost. The recurrent architecture retains competitive performance while reducing parameters by approximately 58%, demonstrating that iterative refinement can effectively replace explicit depth stacking for short contexts.\n",

        "On longer-text and more complex settings, including Yelp reviews and multi-domain classification, recurrent Transformers consistently match or outperform the baseline despite their smaller size. These results indicate that recurrence is particularly effective for modeling long-range dependencies. In deployment-oriented evaluations, FP16 quantization remains stable across architectures, reducing memory usage by about 50% and improving inference latency with negligible performance loss. Overall, recurrent Transformers offer a favorable efficiency–performance trade-off, especially for long-context and cross-domain tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "Our experiments are limited to encoder-only classification tasks, and the benefits of recurrence may not extend directly to generative or sequence-to-sequence models. Effective depth matching is approximate, as recurrent unrolling differs from independently parameterized layers in optimization behavior. Additionally, sequential recurrence may limit parallelism on certain hardware.\n",
